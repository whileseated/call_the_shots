# Readme for Every Shot

**This project does not contain any code.** 

As an experiment, this repository contains painstakingly detailed ReadMe files, that, when fed to corresponding llms, should (but may not) produce workable code that, when combined, reveals the features described below.

In short, each ReadMe file should (when uploaded to an llm) create a single file that can then be used in a project to create a terminal-based app for locally viewing every shot videos, via the command-line. Each ReadMe here has been tested, and the output code has been verified as working.

Here are the files that will be created when the ReadMes are properly processed:
`01_create_entire-field.py` will create `entire-field.csv` 
`02_json_downloader.py` will create a folder of json files 
`video_manager_04.py` 
`ui_components.py` 
`data_manager_05.py` 
`main_06.py` 

You will also need to create a single `config.py` file. No database is necessary.
